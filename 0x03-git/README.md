# GIT

This README update was done through the Github UI as per the requirements of the project.

Git is a version control sysytem, it's a tool that us used to streamline your work with the work of your coworkers so that you may work on the same project. It helps track changes in PC files, and is mainily used in source code management.  It is also free and open souce, meaing the source code is available to everyone.

### It comes with many advantages such as:

  * Cloning
  * Branching:
      This creates a seperate branch from the main branch so that your work can be independant from the main project
  * Adding, commiting and pushing:
      Adding adds your code/changes to the branch you are on but it hasnt been changed on the Github repository
      Commits are a snapshot/milestone of the work you have done so far and it is usually accompanied by a message to keep track of the changes that were made.
      push/ pushing uploads your local repositoy to the remote repository. pushing from main/master is used with the command "git push", but pushing from a branch requires the command "git push origin {branch name}"
